# The-1000-Soil-ICR-Metagenome
This repository contains the codes used for preparing the figures featured in the 1000 Soil Metagenome manuscript.

There are two sub-folders in this repository, one for the R scripts to generate Figs. 1,2,4,5 and 6 and the Python script that was used to pre-process the output of the flux-balanace analysis. The output of the Python script was then inserted into the R script for Fig. 6.
