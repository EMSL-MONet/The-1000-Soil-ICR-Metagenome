# The-1000-Soil-ICR-Metagenome
This repository contains the codes used for preparing the figures featured in the 1000 Soil Metagenome manuscript.

There are two sub-folders in this repository, one for the R scripts to generate Figs. 1,2,4,5 and 6 and the Python script that was used to pre-process the output of the flux-balanace analysis. The output of the Python script was then inserted into the R script for Fig. 6.

**Execution of the scripts**

The R scripts for Figs 1,4, 5 and 6, start with the lines that look like "set(/path_to_data)". Change these lines to reflect the paths where the input files are contained. 
For the R script for Fig. 2, make sure both the code and the folders containing the sample data are in the same path.

The Python code comes with configuration file (*.config).
